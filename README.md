I am a meticulous, patient and committed individual who invests the time and energy to create the desired results in this fast-paced, fast-changing and exciting field.   After the economic downturn in the oil & gas industry in Alberta, Canada, I was long overdue for career change.

A career that can deliver challenge, stability and growth.

A career in which I can enjoy and thrive in for years to come.
